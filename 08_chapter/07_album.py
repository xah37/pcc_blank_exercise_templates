# Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name 
# and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these
# two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries
# representing different albums. Print each return value to show that
# the dictionaries are storing the album information correctly. Use None
# to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store
# the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value
# for the number of songs, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary.
# Make at least one new function call that includes the number of songs
# on an album.
