# Add an attribute called login_attempts to your User class from
# Exercise 9-3 (page 162). Write a method called increment_login_attempts()
# that increments the value of login_attempts by 1. Write another method called
# reset_login_attempts() that resets the value of login_attempts to 0. Make an
# instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts() several times.
# Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented properly,
# and then call reset_login_attempts(). Print login_attempts again to make
# sure it was reset to 0
