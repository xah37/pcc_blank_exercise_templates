# An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. Write a class called
# IceCreamStand that inherits from the Restaurant class you wrote in
# Exercise 9-1 (page 162) or Exercise 9-4 (page 167). Either version of the
# class will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an attribute called
# flavors that stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that
# displays these flavors. Create an instance of IceCreamStand, and call this
# method.
